# Backlog

## Completed

### 2026-02-21 — Governance audit
- Generated 5 operation-specific checklists in `docs/checklists/`:
  - `plugin-manifest-change.md` (HIGH)
  - `agent-definition-change.md` (HIGH)
  - `version-release.md` (MEDIUM)
  - `upstream-contribution.md` (HIGH)
  - `hook-definition-change.md` (HIGH)
- Updated CLAUDE.md with Governance Checklists section linking all 5 checklists

## Known Issues
- None currently

## Technical Debt
- No test suite — checklists are markdown-only, but validation scripts referenced in checklists could be formalised into a test harness
- README.md `docs/checklists/` section is generic — could list the specific checklists generated
